# CFPB Consumer Complaint Dispute Prediction System

This project aims to help banks reduce the cost associated with disputed consumer complaints by using a prediction system based on data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau website.

Created models which would minimize overall cost by 82.11%, recommending the management that the models should be trained on recent (updated) data and be re-evaluated periodically to adjust the threshold to avoid the drifting of the model.
